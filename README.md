# MATH-3439-01
Spotify project for Math 3439

Utilizing the spotify dataset(csv) we focused on what factors or variables would make songs 
popular and what attributes were more correlated and initially we explored and understood the correlation
between all the columns to see if any factors had correlations and could be of use to predict
what songs would be popular and we found that year, acoustiness, energy and loudness, instrumentalness, duration
and danceability had impact on our prediction model where as other variables such as key wouldn't have much 
effect on our linear regression model due to the no trend scatterplot we created during initial findings
which showed no correlation to popularity, with year being the most significant aspect in predicting popularity.
